"saving them to their file records. This normally happens automatically, but "
"there are times when you'll want to extract text from all PDF files that "
"already exist in your Omeka repository, like when first installing this "
"plugin. Check the box below and submit this form to run the text extraction "
"process, which may take some time to finish."
